# Carbon Documents

This package contains PDF definitions for different reports and documents used by applications. It uses the `@react-pdf/renderer` package.

## Importing Fonts

The package does not publish the fonts. Each app that uses this package is responsible for providing the Satoshi fonts at `/fonts/Satoshi-*.ttf`

See `/apps/carbon/public/fonts` for example.
