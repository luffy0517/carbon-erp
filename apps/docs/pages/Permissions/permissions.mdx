# Permissions

Permissions are coarse-grain controls that give or restrict access to a broad resource. Permissions are stored as `JSONB` claims in the `auth.users` table. They are parsed and made ready for use by the application. On the client we use the `usePermissions` hook, and on the server we use the `requirePermissions` function. Both of these functions are relative to the authenticated user.

import { Tabs, Tab } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Tabs items={["Client Side", "Server Side", "Database"]}>
  <Tab>
```tsx
function Component () {
  const permissions = usePermissions();
  
  return 
    (permissions.can('create', 'parts')) 
    ? <Button>Create Part</Button>
    : null
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```ts
export async function loader({request}: LoaderArgs) {
  // a client is needed to access the database
  const { client } = await requirePermission(request, {
    view: "users"
  });

return json(await getEmployees(client));
}

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```sql
CREATE POLICY
"Only users with the parts_view permission can SELECT from Parts"
ON "Parts"
FOR SELECT
USING (coalesce(get_my_claim('parts_view'), false));
````

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

  To bypass all policies and security, a server-side client can be created with
  the `getSupabaseAdmin()` method. This should be used with extreme caution and
  never on the client.
