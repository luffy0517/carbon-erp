## Claims

Permissions and roles are stored in a single `JSONB` column called `raw_app_meta_data` in the `auth.users` table. The reason for storing everything in one row is for faster performance when performing RLS lookups.

Each user has one role and many permissions is stored as key/value pairs, for example:

```json
{
  "role": "EMPLOYEE",
  "parts_view": true,
  "parts_create": false,
  "parts_update": false,
  "parts_delete": false
}
```
