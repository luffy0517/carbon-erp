# Carbon ERP

Carbon is a high permformance, open-source, single tenant (incomplete) ERP written in Typescript. It allows customers, suppliers, and employees to share a common platform that's easy to integrate with.

Technical highlights/roadmap:

- [x] Full-stack type safety (Datbase â†’ UI)
- [x] Realtime database subscriptions
- [x] Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- [x] Row-level security (RLS)
- [x] Composable user groups
- [x] Magic link authentication
- [x] File-based routing
- [ ] Third-party integrations for data
- [ ] Easy-to-use plugin system

Product highlights/roadmap are:

- [x] Search
- [x] Customer and supplier access
- [ ] Double-entry accrual accounting
- [ ] Stochastic scheduling/planning
- [ ] Graph-based routing for manufacturing

## Project Status

- [x] Pre-Alpha: Developing foundation
- [ ] Alpha: Heavy feature development and refinement
- [ ] Public Alpha: Ready for use. But go easy on us, there'll be bugs.
- [ ] Public Beta: Stable enough for most non-enterprise use-cases.
- [ ] Public: Production-ready

## Codebase

The monorepo follows the Turborepo covention of grouping packages into one of two folders.

1. `/apps` for applications
2. `/packages` for shared code

### `/apps`

| Package Name | Description     | Local Command |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------- |
| `carbon`     | ERP Application | `npm run dev` |

### `/packages`

| Package Name           | Description                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `eslint-config-carbon` | Shared, extendable eslint configuration for apps and packages           |
| `@carbon/database`     | Database schema, migrations and types                                   |
| `@carbon/jest`         | Jest preset configuration shared across apps and packages               |
| `@carbon/logger`       | Shared logger used across apps                                          |
| `@carbon/react`        | Shared web-based UI components                                          |
| `@carbon/redis`        | Redis cache client                                                      |
| `@carbon/tsconfig`     | Shared, extendable tsconfig configuration used across apps and packages |
| `@carbon/utils`        | Shared utility functions used across apps and packages                  |

There are two other top-level folders worth mentioning:

| Package Name | Description                                          | Local Command        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `shared`     | A shared API for things like currency exchange rates | `npm run dev:shared` |
| `www`        | The documentation site                               | `npm run dev:www`    |

## Local Development

Make sure that you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) on your system since this monorepo uses the Docker for local development.

After running the steps below you should be able to access the following apps/containers locally:

| Application     | URL                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Carbon ERP      | [http://localhost:3600](http://localhost:3600)                                                                     |
| Postgres        | [postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres](postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres) |
| Supabase Studio | [http://localhost:54323/project/default](http://localhost:54323/project/default)                                   |
| Inbucket        | [http://localhost:54324/monitor](http://localhost:54324/monitor)                                                   |
| Redis           | [redis://localhost:6379](redis://localhost:6379)                                                                   |
| Edge Functions  | [http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/<function-name>](http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/<function-name>)         |

First download and initialize the repository dependencies.

```bash
$ nvm use           # use node v20
$ npm install       # install dependencies
$ npm run db:start  # pull and run the containers
```

Copy the environment variables from the initialization script to an `.env` file:

```
$ cp ./.env.example ./.env
```

After you've set the enviroment variables to the output of `npm run db:start` you can run

```bash
$ npm run db:build     # run db migrations and seed script
$ npm run build        # build the packages
```

Finally, start the apps and packages:

```bash
$ npm run dev         # npm run dev in all apps & packages
```

To kill the database containers in a non-recoverable way, you can run:

```bash
$ npm run db:kill   # stop and delete all database containers
```

To restart and reseed the database, you can run:

```bash
$ npm run db:build # runs db:kill, db:start, and setup
```

To run a particular application, use the `-w workspace` flag.

For example, to run test command in the `@carbon/react` package you can run:

```
$ npm run test -w @carbon/react
```
