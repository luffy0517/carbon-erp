# Overview

The claims administrator can pull three levers to control what users can see and do. Because we use words that are used in different fashions in elsewhere, we'll define them here.

1. **Permissions** - user-specific boolean values for each feature/action

- `TABLE/FEATURE LEVEL`
- The user can view documents
- The user can delete parts

2. **Groups** - a shorthand identifier for a set of users that can access to a specific resource

- `ROW LEVEL`
- The group can view the document
- The group can view the post
- The group can modify the proposal

3. **Roles** - a single string from a predefined set used for row-level filters in the database

- `ROW LEVEL`
- The customer can view sales orders from his organization
- The supplier can view purchase orders from his organization

  Permissions grant broad access, while groups give more fine-grained control.

## Permissions

Each _feature_ (parts, job, timecards) has four corresponding permissions:

1. `*_view`
2. `*_create`
3. `*_update`
4. `*_delete`

So if there were 10 features, then each user would need 40 (4 â¨‰ 10) permissions definitions. That's tedious work.

## Employee Types

To avoid checking 40 checkboxes for each user, we've created model we're calling an **Employee Type** which allow us to define a preset permissions-spec for a type of user (e.g. Engineer). The permissions can be modified at the individual level later, but it's a good starting point for user creation. Employee Types also serve as the users' first group.

## Groups

Users can belong to as many groups as you'd like. The basic gist is that a group is a set of users (or other groups). But ultimately, groups resolve to a set of people that can be used to filter database queries.

## Roles

There are currently only three roles:

1. `EMPLOYEE`
2. `CUSTOMER`
3. `SUPPLIER`

The `CUSTOMER` and `SUPPLIER` roles work to limit what a user can see through Row-Level Security (RLS).
