# Carbon ERP

The major difference between Carbon and other open-source ERPs is the license. ERPs like [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) and [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com/) require that you open-source your code if you use their code. With Carbon, you can use the code as a starting point for your own ERP without having to open-source your code. This is known as a "permissive" license.

## Why Carbon ERP?

We built Carbon ERP because we wanted a real solution to manufacturing scheduling. But in order to solve scheduling, we needed to build routing, which required bill of materials, which required inventory, which required purchasing, and so on. So we built Carbon ERP.

Currently Carbon is missing big chunks of neccessary functionality. By the time it's ready for production, it will have stable support the following modules:

- [x] Accounting
- [x] Inventory
- [x] Purchasing
- [x] Sales
- [x] Manufacturing
- [x] Resources Management
- [x] Timecards
- [x] Bill of Material and Routing Configuration
- [x] Supplier Accounts
- [x] Customer Accounts

We'll then be able to focus on the original goal of scheduling and planning.
