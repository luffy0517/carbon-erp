# Carbon ERP

Carbon ERP is an open-source ERP. There are a few differences between Carbon and other open-source ERPs:

1. ERPs like [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) and [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com/) have "copyleft" licenses, which require that you open-source your code if you use their code as a starting point. With Carbon, you can use the code as a starting point for your own systems without having to open-source your code. This is known as a "permissive" license.
2. Carbon is geared toward manufacturing. Particularly it's solving for matching highly variable demand with highly variable resources in realtime. This is nearly impossible to solve with closed systems.

We wanted a real solution to manufacturing scheduling, and we couldn't find one. But in order to solve scheduling, we needed to build routing, which requires bill of materials, which requires inventory, which required purchasing, and so on. So we built Carbon ERP.

Currently Carbon is missing big chunks of functionality. By the time it's ready for production, it will have stable support all of the modules required to run a manufacturing business.

Then we'll then be able to focus on the original goal of scheduling and planning. In the process we hope to have built something that resembles [Tesla's Warp](https://electrek.co/2016/02/15/tesla-3dx-model-3/).
