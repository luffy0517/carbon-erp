# Setup Accounting

It's good to setup the [chart of accounts](./chart-of-accounts) before any transactions are entered. **This should be done before everything else**. While it's easy to add more specific accounts later, it's best to get the main accounts setup before using the system.

Carbon ERP includes a default chart of accounts that can be used as a starting point. It's recommended to review the default chart of accounts and make any changes before using the system.
