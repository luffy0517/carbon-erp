# Accounting for Purchasing

Carbon uses three ledgers to track the purchasing process:

- **General Ledger** is populated when a line invoiced or received
- **Cost Ledger** is populated when a line is both invoiced and received
- **Part Ledger** is populated when a line is received

## Overview

A purchase order is made of one or more purchase order lines. Each purchase order line is for a specific part, and has a quantity and a price. The price is the price that we expect to pay for the part. The quantity is how many we expect to receive.

The basic accounting flow for purchasing is that a purchase order is created, then the purchase order is received, then the purchase order is invoiced. After the purchase order is received and invoiced, we should have a general ledger entry (journal line) to debit inventory and a general ledger entry to credit accounts payable for each part received.

In practice, it's a little more sophisticated than that. We have to account for the fact that we may receive a partial shipment, or we may receive a shipment that is different than what we ordered. We also have to account for the fact that we may receive a shipment before we receive the invoice, or we may receive the invoice before we receive the shipment. The price may also change between the purchase order and the invoice.

## Posting Groups

Each part has a posting group that determines which accounts we'll use when post to the general ledger. There are two posting groups that are relevant to purchasing:

1. **Inventory Posting Group** determines which general ledger accounts we'll use when we receive a part
2. **Purchase Posting Group** determines which general ledger accounts we'll use when we invoice a part

## General Ledger Entries

In order to decouple the receiving and invoicing processes, we use accrual accounting in the general ledger. This means that we post to the general ledger when we receive a part, and then we post again when we invoice the part. This allows us to receive a part before we receive the invoice, or receive the invoice before we receive the part.

Here are the basic entries that occur depending on the order of the transactions:

- **Goods Received Before Invoice:**
  - **Goods Received:**
    - **Accrual Entry**
      - Debit the asset Interim Inventory Accrual
      - Credit the liability Inventory Received Not Invoiced
  - **Invoice Received:**
    - **Reversing the Accrual Entry:**
      - Debit the liability Inventory Received Not Invoiced
      - Credit the asset Interim Inventory Accrual
        - This reversing entry cancels out the initial accrual
    - **Inventory Entry:**
      - Debit the asset Inventory (from Inventory posting group)
      - Credit the expense Direct Cost Applied (from posting group)
    - **Purchase Entry:**
      - Debit the expense Purchase Account (from Purchasing posting group)
      - Credit the liability Accounts Payable (from posting group)
  - **Payment:**
    - Debit the liability Accounts Payable (from Purchasing posting group)
    - Credit the asset of a Cash or Bank Account (from Bank Account posting group)
- **Invoice Received Before Goods:**
  - **Invoice Received:**
    - **Accrual Entry:**
      - Debit the asset Inventory Invoiced Not Received
      - Credit the asset Interim Inventory Accrual
  - **Goods Received:**
    - **Reversing the Accrual Entry**
      - Debit the asset Interim Inventory Accrual
      - Credit the asset Inventory Invoiced Not Received
    - **Inventory Entry:**
      - Debit the asset Inventory (from Inventory posting group)
      - Credit the expense Direct Cost Applied (from Inventory posting group)
    - **Purchase Entry:**
      - Debit the expense Purchase Account (from Purchasing posting group)
      - Credit the liability Accounts Payable (from Purchasing posting group)
  - **Payment:**
    - Debit the liability Accounts Payable (from Purchasing posting group)
    - Credit the asset of a Cash or Bank Account (from Bank Account posting group)
- **Goods Received and Invoiced at Same Time (no purchase order)**
  - **Goods and Invoiced and Received**
    - **Inventory Entry:**
      - Debit the asset Inventory (from Inventory posting group)
      - Credit the expense Direct Cost Applied (from Inventory posting group)
    - **Purchase Entry:**
      - Debit the expense Purchase Account (from Purchasing posting group)
      - Credit the liability Accounts Payable (from Purchasing posting group)
  - **Payment:**
    - Debit the liability Accounts Payable (from Purchasing posting group)
    - Credit the asset of a Cash or Bank Account (from Bank Account posting group)

On thing that may be surprising here is the **Purchasing Account** and the **Direct Cost Applied** accounts. These are both income statement accounts that offset each other. One benefit of using this setup is that we can see the total amount of purchases of a particular purchasing account directly on the income statement for a period of time. This is useful for understanding the total amount of purchases for a particular group or location at a glance.

## Cost Ledger Entries

The cost ledger is used to track the cost of inventory. The cost ledger is populated when a purchase order line is both invoiced and received. The cost ledger is used to calculate the cost of of a part, particularly in relation to Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).

Unlike the general ledger, the cost ledger is not accrual based. The cost ledger is only populated when a purchase order line is both invoiced and received. Multiple cost ledger entries can be created for a single purchase order line. This can happen when a purchase order line is received in multiple shipments.

Cost ledger entries track quantity and cost.

## Part Ledger Entries

The part ledger is used to track the quantity of inventory. The part ledger is populated when a purchase order line is received. The part ledger is used to track the quantity of inventory on hand, and so entries are tied directly to the receipt of a part without regard for the invoiced amount.
