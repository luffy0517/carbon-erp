# Chart of Accounts

The chart of accounts is a list of all the accounts used by an organization. The chart of accounts is used to organize the finances of the organization and to segregate expenditures, revenue, assets and liabilities in order to give interested parties a better understanding of the financial health of the organization.

## Account Types

Accounts fall into one of two categories: balance sheet accounts and income statement accounts. Balance sheet accounts are used to track assets, liabilities and equity. Income statement accounts are used to track revenue and expenses.

Account categories and subcategories are provided to make it easier to create and edit accounts without worrying about which accounts go where.

You can create an infinite nesting of accounts by using the account types:

- **Begin Total** - The starting account number for a group of accounts
- **End Total** - The ending account number for a group of accounts
- **Posting** - An account that debits and credits are posted to

## Default Accounts

The default accounts form defines the bare-minimum accounts that are needed for automated transactions. There's nothing wrong with using a single account for multiple default accounts. For example, if you didn't care about tracking sales discounts, you could use the same account for both sales discounts and sales revenue.

## Posting Groups

Posting groups are used to define the particular accounts that are used in certain situations (in lieu of the default accounts). For example, you may want to use a different account for sales discounts depending on the customer. You can define a posting group for each customer and then assign the posting group to the customer.
