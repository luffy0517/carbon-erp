# Posting Groups

Posting groups are used to target specific accounts when posting transactions. For example, you may want to post sales of one product line to one account, while posting sales of another product line to a different account. Posting groups allow you to do this.

Different types of posting groups are used in different situations. Posting groups are created automatically and use the default accounts whenever a new group is created.

## Inventory Posting Groups

Inventory posting groups are used to target specific accounts when posting inventory and cost-of-goods sold transactions. An inventory part group is created automatically whenever a **Part Group** is created and whenever a **Location** is created.
