# Carbon ERP

<Features />

Carbon ERP is a high permformance, [open-source](https://github.com/barbinbrad/carbon), single-tenant (incomplete) ERP written in Typescript with web standards. It allows customers, suppliers, and employees to share a common platform.

### High Performance

We've tried to take the best of modern, open-source technology and combine it into a lightning-fast, easy-to-use ERP system. Our pages load quickly, tasks can be completed in seconds, and features can be added in hours instead of years. Our [serverless architecture](/develop/core-concepts/serverless) scales to support business of any size.

### Open Source

For us, open source means [honesty](/develop/principles#openness). We've seen too many companies get locked into expensive, proprietary software that doesn't meet their needs, after being promised that it would.

We think being in business is hard enough, and we'd love it if we could help make it easier. That's why we've licensed Carbon ERP under the permissive [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license. This means that you can use Carbon ERP for free, and you can modify it to meet your needs.

### Single Tenant

Unlike most cloud-based ERP systems, Carbon ERP is designed to be a single-tenant system. This means that all of your data is stored in a single database, which is private to your company. This allows you to have complete control over your data, and to keep it secure.

### Realtime

We have first-class [support for realtime](/develop/core-concepts/realtime) data updates on any data in the system. While realtime is not the default, it can be added anywhere.

### Manufacturing

Carbon has first-class support for American manufacturing.
