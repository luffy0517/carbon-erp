# Getting Started

Before getting started with development, it's good to have a basic understanding of our [tech stack](/docs/tech-stack).

You'll also need to have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) on your system since this monorepo uses the Docker for local development.

After running the steps below you should be able to access the following apps/containers locally:

| Application     | URL                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Carbon ERP      | [http://localhost:3600](http://localhost:3600)                                                                     |
| Postgres        | [postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres](postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres) |
| Supabase Studio | [http://localhost:54323/project/default](http://localhost:54323/project/default)                                   |
| Inbucket        | [http://localhost:54324/monitor](http://localhost:54324/monitor)                                                   |
| Redis           | [redis://localhost:6379](redis://localhost:6379)                                                                   |
| Edge Functions  | [http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/<function-name>](http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/<function-name>)         |

First download and initialize the repository dependencies.

```bash
$ nvm use           # use node v20
$ npm install       # install dependencies
$ npm run db:start  # pull and run the containers
```

Copy the environment variables from the initialization script to an `.env` file:

```
$ cp ./.env.example ./.env
```

After you've set the enviroment variables to the output of `npm run db:start` you can run

```bash
$ npm run db:build     # run db migrations and seed script
$ npm run build        # build the packages
```

Finally, start the apps and packages:

```bash
$ npm run dev         # npm run dev in all apps & packages
```

To kill the database containers in a non-recoverable way, you can run:

```bash
$ npm run db:kill   # stop and delete all database containers
```

To restart and reseed the database, you can run:

```bash
$ npm run db:build # runs db:kill, db:start, and setup
```

To run a particular application, use the `-w workspace` flag.

For example, to run test command in the `@carbon/react` package you can run:

```
$ npm run test -w @carbon/react
```
