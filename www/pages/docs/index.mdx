# Carbon ERP

<Features />

Carbon ERP is a high permformance, [open-source](https://github.com/barbinbrad/carbon), single-tenant (incomplete) ERP written in Typescript with web standards. It allows customers, suppliers, and employees to share a common platform.

### High Performance

We've tried to take the best of modern, open-source technology and combine it into a lightning-fast, easy-to-use ERP system. Our pages load quickly, tasks can be completed in seconds, and features can be added in hours instead of years. Our [serverless architecture](/core-concepts/serverless) scales to support business of any size.

### Open Source

For us, open source means [honesty](/principles/open-source). We've seen too many companies get locked into expensive, proprietary software that doesn't meet their needs, after being promised that it would.

We think manufacturing is hard enough, and we'd love it if we could help make it easier. We're always looking for new contributors to help us build the best ERP for manufacturing.

### Single Tenant

Unlike most cloud-based ERP systems, Carbon ERP is designed to be a single-tenant system. This means that all of your data is stored in a single database, which is private to your company. This allows you to have complete control over your data, and to keep it secure.

### Realtime

We have first-class [support for realtime](/core-concepts/realtime) data updates on any data in the system.

### Manufacturing

ERPs are general-purpose systems. They're designed to be used by any company, in any industry. This means that they're often bloated with features that you don't need, and don't work well with the way you do business. Carbon ERP is designed specifically for manufacturing, and we've built it to be easy to use and easy to customize.
