# Permissions

There are two types of permissions in the system:

1. **Module permissions** - These are permissions that are specific to a module. For example, a user may have permission to view the sales module, but not to create, update or delete sales.
2. **Role permissions** - These are permissions that are specific to a role. For example, customers may be able to view the sales module, but a customer role limits the data to only their own sales, where an employee with the same permission can view all sales.

A user's permissions are stored in the `auth.users` table in the `raw_app_meta_data` column.

The JSON permissions data in that column something like this:

```json
{
  "role": "employee",
  ...
  "sales_view": true,
  "sales_create": true,
  "sales_update": true,
  "sales_delete": false,
  ...
  "purchasing_view": false,
  "purchasing_create": false,
  "purchasing_update": false,
  "purchasing_delete": false,
  ...
}
```

Each user has a **role**, which may be one of the following:

- `employee`
- `customer`
- `supplier`

Additionally, each user has a set of permissions for each module. Generally, the permissions are:

- `<module>_view`
- `<module>_create`
- `<module>_update`
- `<module>_delete`

Permissions are managed within the user module. **An employees' permissions are set according to the default permissions for their employee type when the user is created**. Each employee may then be fined tuned for individual permissions in the users module. There is also an option to bulk update permissions for employees.

Currently, all customers and suppliers have hard-coded permissions, which are set when the customer account or supplier account is created.

## Permissions in the Code

There are three places where permissions can be used in the code. In order of precedence, they are:

1. **Database row-level security (RLS)** - an in-database policy, written in SQL, that limits the data that a user can see or modify.
2. **Server-side permission checks** - a helper function that checks the user's permissions before making a call to the database.
3. **Client-side permission checks** - a helper function that checks the user's permissions before making a call to the server.

It is most important to use RLS. But server-side and client-side mechanisms can be used as additional security measures. RLS is expensive, so we use server-side and client-side checks to avoid making unnecessary calls to the database.

### Database Row-Level Security

Here is an example of how to use RLS policies to limit a user's rights to modify a table using the `get_my_claim` function. This is SQL that's run against the database to create a security policy for the `customer` table. If you're not familiar with the `::bolean` and `::jsonb` syntax, that's just casting the value to a boolean or jsonb type. The `get_my_claim` function is a custom function that returns the value of a claim from the user's permissions record. The `auth.uid()` function returns the user's ID.

```sql
-- SQL

ALTER TABLE "customer" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Employees with sales_view can view customer" ON "customer"
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    coalesce(get_my_claim('sales_view')::boolean, false) = true
    AND (get_my_claim('role'::text)) = '"employee"'::jsonb
  );

CREATE POLICY "Customers with sales_view can their own organization" ON "customer"
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    coalesce(get_my_claim('sales_view')::boolean, false) = true
    AND (get_my_claim('role'::text)) = '"customer"'::jsonb
    AND id IN (
      SELECT "customerId" FROM "customerAccount" WHERE id::uuid = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Employees with sales_create can create customers" ON "customer"
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    coalesce(get_my_claim('sales_create')::boolean, false)
    AND (get_my_claim('role'::text)) = '"employee"'::jsonb
  );

CREATE POLICY "Employees with sales_update can update customers" ON "customer"
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    coalesce(get_my_claim('sales_update')::boolean, false)
    AND (get_my_claim('role'::text)) = '"employee"'::jsonb
  );

CREATE POLICY "Customers with sales_update can their own organization" ON "customer"
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    coalesce(get_my_claim('sales_update')::boolean, false) = true
    AND (get_my_claim('role'::text)) = '"customer"'::jsonb
    AND id IN (
      SELECT "customerId" FROM "customerAccount" WHERE id::uuid = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Employees with sales_delete can delete customers" ON "customer"
  FOR DELETE
  USING (
    coalesce(get_my_claim('sales_delete')::boolean, false) = true
    AND (get_my_claim('role'::text)) = '"employee"'::jsonb
  );

```

### Server-Side Permission Checks

We provide a helper function called `requirePermissions` that can be used to check the user's permissions before making a call to the database. This method is almost always called in an action (data write) or a loader (data fetch).

Here is an example of how to use it in a loader:

```tsx
export async function loader({ request }: LoaderArgs) {
  const { client } = requirePermissions(request, {
    view: "sales",
    role: "employee",
  });

  // call to the database
}
```

In this example, the user must have the `sales_view` permission and the `employee` role in order to access the loader. If the user does not have the required permissions, an `Access denied` error will be thrown, and the user will be redirected to the root page.

We can also required multiple permissions. In the next example, the user must have the `sales_update` permission and the `users_update` permission in order to invoke the action:

```tsx
export async function action({ request }: ActionArgs) {
  const { client } = requirePermissions(request, {
    update: ["sales", "users"],
  });

  // call to the database
}
```

### Client-Side Permission Checks

Finally, we can use client-side permission checks to limit what the user can do in the UI. This is done using the `usePermissions` hook. It provides two methods:

1. `can` - a function that takes a module (sales) and an action (view, create, update, delete) and returns a boolean indicating whether the user has the required permission.
2. `is` - a function that takes a role (employee, customer, supplier) and returns a boolean indicating whether the user has the required role.

Here's an example of how we might use client-side permission checks to hide the NewSalesForm component if the user does not have the `sales_create` permission:

```tsx
import { usePermissions } from "~/hooks";

export default function SalesList() {
  const permissions = usePermissions();

  return <>{permissions.can("create", "sales") && <NewSalesForm />}</>;
}
```
