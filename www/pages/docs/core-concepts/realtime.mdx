# Realtime

There are two basic use cases for realtime data in Carbon ERP:

1. Listening for async events to complete
2. Minimizing the number of requests for popular data

## Listening for async events to complete

When a user performs an action that triggers an async event (a job is inserted into a queue), the UI should listen for updates to the table to be updated.

This can be done easily with the `useRealtime` hook:

```tsx
// listen for udpates to the receipt table
useRealtime("receipt");
```

A smaller subset of the table can be listened to by passing a second argument. Here we listen for the rows with an `id` of `1`, `2`, or `3`:

```tsx
useRealtime("receipt", "id=in.(1,2,3)");
```

Whenever a row is updated, the data for the page will be re-fetched.

## Minimizing the number of requests for popular data

Some data like the list of parts, customers, and suppliers are used on many pages. And regularly refetching thousands of rows is not ideal. To avoid making a request for this data on every page, we load it once in the `<RealtimeDataProvider>` on page load. We then put the data from each table into a nanostore hook that has a getter and setter that can be accessed from any page. For example:

```tsx
import { useParts } from "~/stores";

const [parts, setParts] = useParts();
```

Without realtime, this data would quickly become stale. To keep data fresh, the `<RealtimeDataProvider>` listens for updates to the table and update the nanostore hook accordingly. This means that the data will be updated on every page that uses the hook.

Here is the basic pattern for listening to updates to a table in the `<RealtimeDataProvider>` component and updating the store:

```tsx
const { supabase } = useSupabase();
const [, setParts] = useParts();

useEffect(() => {
  // fetch the all parts from the database and setParts to it's initial value
  fetchData();

  // listen for updates to the table and update the parts store
  const channel = supabase
    .channel("realtime:core")
    .on(
      "postgres_changes",
      {
        event: "*",
        schema: "public",
        table: "part",
      },
      (payload) => {
        switch (payload.eventType) {
          case "INSERT":
            const { new: inserted } = payload;
            setParts((parts) => [
              ...parts,
              {
                id: inserted.id,
                name: inserted.name,
                replenishmentSystem: inserted.replenishmentSystem,
              },
            ]);
            break;
          case "UPDATE":
            const { new: updated } = payload;
            setParts((parts) =>
              parts.map((p) => {
                if (p.id === updated.id) {
                  return {
                    ...p,
                    name: updated.name,
                    replenishmentSystem: updated.replenishmentSystem,
                  };
                }
                return p;
              })
            );
            break;
          case "DELETE":
            const { old: deleted } = payload;
            setParts((parts) => parts.filter((p) => p.id !== deleted.id));
            break;
          default:
            break;
        }
      }
    )
    .subscribe();

  return () => {
    if (channel) supabase?.removeChannel(channel);
  };
}, []);
```
