# Tech Stack

Our tech stack aims to be as simple as possible, while still being powerful enough to build any web application. We use the following technologies:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is the programming language
- [React](https://reactjs.org) for the frontend
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) for the UI components
- [Remix](https://remix.run) for the routing and compiling
- [Supabase](https://supabase.io) for the database and authentication

We also use [Redis](https://redis.io) for caching and [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for hosting, though in most cases you probably won't need those.

In this page, we'll give you a basic overview of how the tech stack works together. If you want to learn more about any of the technologies, we recommend checking out their documentation.

## TypeScript

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is a programming language that builds on top of JavaScript. It adds a bunch of features that make it easier to write code, and it also makes it easier to catch bugs before you ship your code.

We chose TypeScript because it allows us to use a single, strongly-typed language across the entire application. Every time you run `yarn db:build`, we use Supabase to generate TypeScript types for your database schema.

## React

[React](https://reactjs.org) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's the most popular frontend framework in the world, and it's used by many of the biggest companies in the world, including Facebook, Netflix, and Airbnb.

We have a package called [@carbon/react](https://github.com/barbinbrad/carbon/tree/main/packages/react/src) that has a bunch of React pre-built components that you can use to build your UI. You can also draw from a rich ecosystem of existing React component libraries.

## Chakra UI

[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) is a lightweight and flexible component library that gives us accessibility, full-control, and simplicty. It implements the WAI-ARIA spec behaviors with some basic primitive components (like Button and Modal) while providing an easy-to-modify API for customizing the design.

Here's an example of a Chakra UI button:

```jsx
import { Button } from "@chakra-ui/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <Button size="lg" variant="outline">
      Click me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

There are a lot of other component libraries out there, but we chose Chakra UI because it gives us a lot of flexibility while providing great user and developer experience.

## Remix

[Remix](https://remix.run) is a framework for building full-stack web applications. It's built on top of React, and it allows us to co-locate server-side code and client-side code in the same files. When combined with TypeScript and Supabase, this gives us type-safety from the database to the UI.

Remix makes for a beautiful developer experience. It's use of nested routes, [loaders, actions and components](https://remix.run/blog/remix-data-flow) **minimizes the amount of code that needs written while maximzing performance**. To learn more about Remix, check out their documentation, and take a look at some files from our [routes](https://github.com/barbinbrad/carbon/tree/main/apps/carbon/app/routes) directory.

Here's a slightly-simplified example of how a Remix route works:

```tsx
// File (route): /products/$productId/edit.tsx

export async function loader({ params }) {
  const product = await database.getProduct(params.productId);
  return json(product);
}

export default function Route() {
  const product = useLoaderData();
  return (
    <h2>Edit Product {product.id}</h2>
    <Form method="post">
      <input name="name" defaultValue={product.name} />
      <input name="price" defaultValue={product.price} />
      <button type="submit">Save</button>
    </Form>
  )
}

export async function action({params, request}) {
  const form = await request.formData();
  const name = form.get("name");
  const price = form.get("price");
  const product = await database.updateProduct({ id: params.productId, name, price });
  return redirect(`/products/${product.id}`);
}
```

## Supabase

[Supabase](https://supabase.io) is a database, authentication, and storage service that's built on top of Postgres. It allows us to provide a simple, unified authentication layer across many applications (even those that don't exist yet).

Supabase provides a TypeScript client called [Supabase JS](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/typescript-support) that makes it incredibly easy to query/modify the database. It also makes it easy to use row-level security to restrict access to certain parts of the database on a per-user basis.

Here's a look at how you can use Supabase JS to query the database from a Remix loader where `client` is the supabase client specific to the user making the request:

```tsx
export async function loader({request}) {
  const { client } = requirePermissions(request, view: 'purchasing');
  const { data, error } = await client
    .from('purchaseOrder')
    .select(`
      id, name,
      customer(id, name),
      purchaseOrderItems(id, name, quantity, unitPrice, total)
    `)
    .order('createdAt', { ascending: false })
    .limit(10);

  if (error) {
    return redirect('/');
  }

  return json(data);
}
```

This is equivalent to the following SQL query.

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  customer.id,
  customer,name
  purchaseOrderItems.id,
  purchaseOrderItems.name,
  purchaseOrderItems.quantity,
  purchaseOrderItems.unitPrice,
  purchaseOrderItems.total
FROM "purchaseOrder"
INNER JOIN "customer" ON "customer"."id" = "purchaseOrder"."customerId"
LEFT JOIN "purchaseOrderItem" ON "purchaseOrderItem"."purchaseOrderId" = "purchaseOrder"."id"
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 10
```

But unlike a raw SQL query, the data that we get back is strongly-typed, neatly-nested, with error handling built-in.
