# Principles

Decision-making is guided by four principles:

1. Simplicity
2. Extensibility
3. Openness
4. Productivity

## Simplicity

We understand that manufacturers don't often have the luxury of large teams of developers. Often a single software developer will be responsible for many custom applications. Our goal is to provide **a simple platform with a single database** that manufacturers can use as **the heart of their digital operations**.

To provide simplicity we use these approaches:

- Best open-source software
- Minimal languages (TypeScript and SQL)
- Minimal dependencies
- Single-purpose examples and templates
- Strong documentation
- Total transparency

## Extensibility

**Every manufacturer has unique needs that are not covered by the standard platform**. We want to make it easy to extend the platform to meet their needs.

To provide extensibility we have the following goals:

- Easy to add custom applications
- Easy to add API endpoints
- Easy to add custom database tables
- Easy to add modules and interfaces to the primary application

## Openness

The ERP system is the heart of a manufactuer's digital operation. We want to make sure that they can easily integrate with other systems and customize it in any way that they need. **The only real way to do this that to make the source code available**.

An open source ERP system has a number of benefits, including:

- Lower costs
- Greater flexibility
- Better security

## Productivity

When making decisions, we aim to **optimize for long-term developer productivity**. We take it as a given that everyone wants more features. But in order to quickly provide new features over time, we need to make sure that the platform is easy to use and maintain.
